                    <p id="text">Firstly, an automated warehouse needs to be substantially faster than warehouses powered by human workforce. The most important thing is to speed up the process as much as it is possible. The robots will know the fastest way to reach their goal through mathematical equations. Once they know their fastest route, they will faithfully follow it with no hesitation in the most effective manner.</p>

                    <p id="titlu">How and where will the customer need it?</p>
                    <p id="text">The robots are being developed in order to be used in logistical processes, not only in warehouses, but mostly in factories. Breweries are our main focus mainly because the factory and the distribution centre are in the same location; most importantly the pallets/loads are monolithic.
                    As soon as the products exit the production line, the bottles and cans are being piled up and organised in boxes that are eventually formed into pallets. The robots need to take the soon finished pallets and transport them all the way to the trucks, and ultimately, loading the trucks.</p>

                    <p id="text">This product was not designed specifically for breweries, as mentioned before, these particular robots can handle any monolithic loads. As long as this principle and main design is maintained, the robots are highly adaptable to many industries, such as: dairy products,  seed sector, pork meat industry… etc. As long as the load is equally balanced, the robots can adapt. </p>
